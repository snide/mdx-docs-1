Xata has multiple Open Source projects hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/xataio), from our SDKs, blogs and the docs that you are reading this moment.
On this page we'll cover some tipps for you to get started if you want to contribute. 

First things first, thank you for considering contributing! Community involvement goes further than a single commit, every issue you open helps us make a better product for you.
The easiest way to get your feet wet is our docs, which are compiled in the [mdx-docs](repository). 
You can use the _Edit on GitHub_ button located on each page underneath the page title or clone the repository.

## SDK and Integrations

Your favourite language does not have a Xata SDK, and your fingers are itching to create one? Collecting all the necessary information can be overwhelming.
Our API is defined via [OpenAPI specifications](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification). We employ a model with multiple specifications, each one has it's own purpose and URL, more details are available on [this page](/docs/rest-api/contexts).

A good place to start is to learn how make a first request to ensure you have [authentication](/docs/rest-api/authentication) properly working.
Fetching your workspaces is perfect candidate as it is a simple `GET` request, you can find an example curl request [here](/docs/rest-api/authentication#sending-an-authenticated-request).
If you are all set, and can retrive your workspaces from Xata, you can either pull the [OpenAPI specifications](/docs/rest-api/contexts#openapi-specifications) or go to the [REST API](/docs/api-reference/user#get-user-details)

We are happy to help you with any questions you have and also [showcase your work](/blog/community-spotlight-xata-go-sdk), please don't hesitate to [get in touch](#get-in-touch) with us!
