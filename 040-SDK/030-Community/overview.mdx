Delve into this exhaustive guide outlining the complete array of objects and methods within the Xata's community-driven SDKs. This resource empowers you to seamlessly engage with your Postgres database, stay attuned to dynamic database alterations, trigger Deno Edge Functions, forge user login and management functionality, and handle files.

The community client libraries and SDKs are the fruit of collective efforts within the Xata community, and it's not an official offering. With any ongoing developments within the library, and as with all libraries, your contributions welcomed.

Community SDKs are cuurently available for the following languages:

- [Go](https://github.com/kerdokurs/xata-go)

## Contribute

Contribute if your favorite language does not have a Xata SDK, and your fingers are itching to create one. Collecting all the necessary information can be overwhelming.
Our API is defined via [OpenAPI specifications](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification). We employ a model with multiple specifications, each one has it's own purpose and URL, more details are available on [this page](/docs/rest-api/contexts).

A good place to start is to learn how make a first request to ensure you have [authentication](/docs/rest-api/authentication) properly working.
Fetching your workspaces is perfect candidate as it is a simple `GET` request, you can find an example curl request [here](/docs/rest-api/authentication#sending-an-authenticated-request).
If you are all set, and can retrive your workspaces from Xata, you can either pull the [OpenAPI specifications](/docs/rest-api/contexts#openapi-specifications) or go to the [REST API](/docs/api-reference/user#get-user-details)

We are happy to help you with any questions you have and also [showcase your work](/blog/community-spotlight-xata-go-sdk), please don't hesitate to [get in touch](#get-in-touch) with us!
